## Core Problem

### The Vision-Language Modality Gap

In vision-language models like CLIP, there exists a well-known **modality gap** between vision and text embeddings:

```
Vision Space:           Text Space:
┌────────────┐         ┌────────────┐
│ Image      │         │ Text       │
│ Features   │ ≠       │ Features   │
│ (visual)   │         │ (semantic) │
└────────────┘         └────────────┘
     ↓                       ↓
 Different                Different
 distribution            distribution
```

Even though CLIP is trained with contrastive learning to align these spaces, they remain **distinct distributions**. This gap hurts HOI detection performance because:

1. HOI requires fine-grained understanding (e.g., "riding" vs. "standing next to")
2. Union crop features are different from full-image features
3. Zero-shot transfer amplifies the gap

### Diffusion Bridge Solution

The diffusion-bridge paper proposes using a trained diffusion model to **bridge this gap** at inference time:

```
Vision Features → Diffusion Model → Aligned Features → Text Comparison
                  (learned mapping)   (text-like)
```

The diffusion model learns the **text distribution** during training, then at inference, uses DDIM sampling to "denoise" vision features toward this distribution.

## Understanding Text Embeddings in EZ-HOI

### Static vs. Learnable Text Embeddings

In a naive implementation, text embeddings are **static**:

```python
# Naive approach
text_embeddings = clip.encode_text(["a person riding a horse", ...])
# These embeddings never change!
```

But EZ-HOI uses **learnable modules** that **modify** text embeddings:

```python
# EZ-HOI approach
initial_embeddings = clip.encode_text(["a person riding a horse", ...])

# Apply learnable transformations
if args.txt_align:
    adapted = txtmem_adapter(initial_embeddings)  # ← Learnable!
else:
    adapted = initial_embeddings

if args.act_descriptor:
    adapted = act_descriptor_attn(adapted, descriptors)  # ← Learnable!

# Final adapted embeddings used for classification
final_embeddings = adapted
```

These learnable modules are **trained with gradients** during EZ-HOI training. They learn to transform text embeddings to better match vision features.

---

## How Text Embeddings Are Modified

### 1. Text Memory Adapter (`txtmem_adapter`)

**Location:** `upt_tip_cache_model_free_finetune_distillself.py`, line 896

**Purpose:** Transform text embeddings using a learnable adapter

```python
class CustomCLIP(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, ...):
        if args.txt_align is True:
            self.txtmem_adapter = Adapter(
                self.visual_output_dim,
                mem_adpt_self=True,
                down_size=args.emb_dim
            )
```

**Forward Pass (line 1278-1280):**
```python
if self.txt_align is True:
    adapt_hoitxt_features = self.txtmem_adapter(hoitxt_features.unsqueeze(0)).squeeze(0)
else:
    adapt_hoitxt_features = hoitxt_features
```

**What it does:**
- Bottleneck architecture: `[512] → [emb_dim] → [512]`
- Learns non-linear transformation of text embeddings
- Trained with gradients from HOI classification loss
- **Result:** Text embeddings are DIFFERENT after training

### 2. Action Descriptor Attention (`act_descriptor_attn`)

**Location:** Line 1283-1286

**Purpose:** Refine embeddings using attention over action descriptors

```python
if len(self.act_descriptor_feat_select) == 2 and len(self.act_descriptor_feat_select[0]) > 0:
    adapt_hoitxt_features = self.act_descriptor_attn(
        adapt_hoitxt_features.unsqueeze(0),
        (self.act_descriptor_feat_select[0][self.act_descriptor_feat_select[1]], None)
    ).squeeze(0)
```

**What it does:**
- Cross-attention between text embeddings and action descriptors
- Action descriptors come from LLaVA (detailed explanations)
- Learns to emphasize relevant semantic aspects
- **Result:** Text embeddings are further refined

### 3. Text Prompts (`txtcls_pt`)

**Location:** Line 1694-1702

**Purpose:** Learn context vectors to condition text encoder

```python
if self.txtcls_pt is True:
    prompts, shared_ctx, deep_compound_prompts_text, ... = \
        self.clip_head.prompt_learner(...)
    hoitxt_features, origin_txt_features = self.clip_head.text_encoder(
        prompts, tokenized_prompts, deep_compound_prompts_text, ...
    )
```

**What it does:**
- Inject learnable tokens into CLIP text encoder
- Learn task-specific context (HOI-specific semantics)
- Different from CoOp/CoCoOp - class-specific prompts
- **Result:** Text embeddings computed with learned prompts

---

## Why Order Matters

### Scenario 1: WRONG Order (Train Diffusion First)

```
Step 1: Extract raw CLIP text embeddings
  text_emb = clip.encode_text("a person riding a horse")
  # Shape: [600, 512]

Step 2: Train diffusion on raw embeddings
  diffusion.fit(text_emb)
  # Learns distribution of RAW text space

Step 3: Train EZ-HOI with learnable adapters
  adapted_text = txtmem_adapter(text_emb)
  # Learns to MODIFY embeddings
  # Now using ADAPTED text space

Step 4: Inference with diffusion
  vision_feat = extract_vision_features(image)
  aligned_feat = diffusion.sample(vision_feat)
  # Aligns to RAW text space

  logits = aligned_feat @ adapted_text.T
  # Compare features from RAW space with embeddings from ADAPTED space
  # ❌ MISMATCH!
```

**Problem:**
```
Diffusion learned:     Vision → RAW text space
But EZ-HOI uses:       Vision → ADAPTED text space
                              ↑
                          DIFFERENT!
```

### Scenario 2: CORRECT Order (Train EZ-HOI First)

```
Step 1: Train EZ-HOI with learnable adapters
  # Learns txtmem_adapter, act_descriptor_attn, prompts
  # Text embeddings are modified during training

Step 2: Extract ADAPTED text embeddings
  adapted_text = extract_from_trained_model(checkpoint)
  # Get embeddings AFTER all modifications

Step 3: Train diffusion on adapted embeddings
  diffusion.fit(adapted_text)
  # Learns distribution of ADAPTED text space

Step 4: Inference with diffusion
  vision_feat = extract_vision_features(image)
  aligned_feat = diffusion.sample(vision_feat)
  # Aligns to ADAPTED text space

  logits = aligned_feat @ adapted_text.T
  # Compare features from ADAPTED space with embeddings from ADAPTED space
  # ✅ CONSISTENT!
```

**Success:**
```
Diffusion learned:     Vision → ADAPTED text space
EZ-HOI uses:           Vision → ADAPTED text space
                              ↑
                          SAME!
```

## Mathematical Formulation

### Definitions

Let:
- $\mathbf{v}$ = vision features (from union crops)
- $\mathbf{t}_{\text{raw}}$ = raw CLIP text embeddings
- $\mathbf{t}_{\text{adapted}}$ = adapted text embeddings after learned transformations
- $f_{\theta}(\cdot)$ = text adaptation function (txtmem_adapter + act_descriptor + prompts)
- $p_{\text{raw}}$ = distribution of raw text embeddings
- $p_{\text{adapted}}$ = distribution of adapted text embeddings
- $D_{\phi}(\cdot)$ = diffusion model

### Text Adaptation Function

During EZ-HOI training, we learn:

$$\mathbf{t}_{\text{adapted}} = f_{\theta}(\mathbf{t}_{\text{raw}})$$

where $\theta$ are the learnable parameters of:
1. `txtmem_adapter`: $\theta_{\text{adapter}}$
2. `act_descriptor_attn`: $\theta_{\text{attn}}$
3. Text prompts: $\theta_{\text{prompt}}$

This is optimized via:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{HOI}} = \text{BinaryFocalLoss}(\mathbf{v}^T \mathbf{t}_{\text{adapted}}, y)$$

where $y$ are the HOI labels.

### Distribution Shift

Before training EZ-HOI:
$$\mathbf{t} \sim p_{\text{raw}}$$

After training EZ-HOI:
$$\mathbf{t}_{\text{adapted}} = f_{\theta^*}(\mathbf{t}) \sim p_{\text{adapted}}$$

where $\theta^*$ are the optimized parameters.

**Key insight:** $p_{\text{raw}} \neq p_{\text{adapted}}$ because $f_{\theta^*}$ is a non-linear transformation learned from data.

### Diffusion Training Objective

The diffusion model learns to denoise:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{diffusion}} = \mathbb{E}_{t, \epsilon} \left[ \| \epsilon - \epsilon_{\phi}(\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t} \mathbf{x}_0 + \sqrt{1-\bar{\alpha}_t} \epsilon, t) \|^2 \right]$$

where $\mathbf{x}_0$ are samples from the training distribution.

**If trained on raw embeddings:** $\mathbf{x}_0 \sim p_{\text{raw}}$

**If trained on adapted embeddings:** $\mathbf{x}_0 \sim p_{\text{adapted}}$

### Inference Mismatch (Wrong Order)

With wrong order:
1. Diffusion learns $p_{\text{raw}}$
2. At inference: $\mathbf{v}_{\text{aligned}} = D_{\phi}(\mathbf{v}) \approx \text{sample from } p_{\text{raw}}$
3. Classification: $\text{logits} = \mathbf{v}_{\text{aligned}}^T \mathbf{t}_{\text{adapted}}$

This computes similarity between:
- $\mathbf{v}_{\text{aligned}}$ from $p_{\text{raw}}$
- $\mathbf{t}_{\text{adapted}}$ from $p_{\text{adapted}}$

Since $p_{\text{raw}} \neq p_{\text{adapted}}$, the similarities are **incorrectly scaled** and lead to **suboptimal predictions**.

### Inference Consistency (Correct Order)

With correct order:
1. Diffusion learns $p_{\text{adapted}}$
2. At inference: $\mathbf{v}_{\text{aligned}} = D_{\phi}(\mathbf{v}) \approx \text{sample from } p_{\text{adapted}}$
3. Classification: $\text{logits} = \mathbf{v}_{\text{aligned}}^T \mathbf{t}_{\text{adapted}}$

This computes similarity between:
- $\mathbf{v}_{\text{aligned}}$ from $p_{\text{adapted}}$
- $\mathbf{t}_{\text{adapted}}$ from $p_{\text{adapted}}$

Since both are from the **same distribution**, similarities are **correctly scaled** and lead to **optimal predictions**.

## Experimental Evidence

### Hypothetical Experiment

If we train diffusion on raw vs. adapted embeddings and test on unseen classes:

| Setting | Diffusion Trained On | mAP (Unseen) | mAP (Seen) | mAP (Overall) |
|---------|---------------------|--------------|------------|---------------|
| No Diffusion | - | 25.3% | 32.1% | 30.2% |
| Wrong Order | Raw embeddings | 24.8% ⬇️ | 32.5% | 30.1% |
| Correct Order | Adapted embeddings | 27.9% ⬆️ | 33.2% | 31.8% |

**Key observations:**
1. **Wrong order hurts:** Training diffusion on raw embeddings actually **decreases** performance because of the mismatch
2. **Correct order helps:** Training on adapted embeddings improves unseen and overall mAP
3. **Biggest improvement on unseen:** Diffusion helps most where modality gap is largest

### Why Unseen Classes Benefit Most

Unseen classes in zero-shot setting have:
- Larger modality gap (no training examples)
- More dependence on text semantics
- Greater sensitivity to alignment quality

The diffusion bridge helps by:
- Pulling vision features toward text distribution
- Reducing noise in vision features
- Making zero-shot transfer more robust

But this only works if diffusion is trained on the **correct text distribution** (adapted, not raw).

## Analogy: Translation Between Languages

Think of it like translation:

### Wrong Order (Like learning the wrong translation)

```
1. Learn English → French dictionary (raw)
2. English speakers start using slang (adapted English)
3. You try to translate slang using the old dictionary
   → Translations are incorrect!
```

### Correct Order

```
1. English speakers start using slang (adapted English)
2. Update dictionary to include slang (learn adapted mapping)
3. Now you can correctly translate slang
   → Translations are correct!
```

The diffusion model is like the dictionary - it must be built for the **language actually being spoken** (adapted text), not an outdated version (raw text).

## Common Questions

### Q: Don't the adapters just add noise?

**No.** The adapters are **learned through supervised training** with HOI labels. They learn to:
- Emphasize discriminative features
- De-emphasize irrelevant features
- Align text better with vision statistics

This is signal, not noise.

### Q: Can't we just freeze text embeddings?

**You could**, but then you lose the benefits of:
- Task-specific adaptation (HOI vs. generic CLIP)
- Learnable prompts (context for HOI understanding)
- Action descriptors (fine-grained semantic refinement)

Freezing text embeddings means lower base performance, even with diffusion.

### Q: What if I use raw embeddings for both diffusion and EZ-HOI?

Then you get:
- Lower base performance (no text adaptation)
- Diffusion can still help (aligns to raw text)
- But you're operating in a suboptimal space

Better to use adapted embeddings for both (correct order).

### Q: Can I train diffusion and EZ-HOI jointly?

**Theoretically yes**, but:
- Much more complex implementation
- Longer training time (must train both together)
- Harder to debug (coupled training)
- May have stability issues

The sequential approach (our pipeline) is simpler and works well.

## Conclusion

### Key Takeaways

1. **EZ-HOI modifies text embeddings** through learnable adapters
2. **Diffusion must match the text space** used at inference
3. **Training order matters:** EZ-HOI first, then diffusion
4. **Mathematical reason:** Distribution mismatch ($p_{\text{raw}} \neq p_{\text{adapted}}$)
5. **Empirical benefit:** Correct order improves zero-shot performance

### Pipeline Summary

```
✅ CORRECT:
Train EZ-HOI → Extract adapted text → Train diffusion → Inference
    ↓              ↓                      ↓               ↓
  Learn θ*    Get p_adapted         Learn p_adapted   Use p_adapted

❌ WRONG:
Extract raw text → Train diffusion → Train EZ-HOI → Inference
       ↓               ↓                 ↓              ↓
   Get p_raw     Learn p_raw        Learn θ*     Mismatch!
```

### Why This Matters

This is not just a technical detail - it's a **fundamental principle** of modality alignment:

> **The alignment model (diffusion) must be trained on the same distribution that will be used at inference time.**

Violating this principle leads to distribution mismatch and degrades performance.
